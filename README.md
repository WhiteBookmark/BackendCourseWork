â€¢ [Back-End] MongoDB should have (8%): 

[X] A. a collection for lesson information (minimal fields: topic, price, location, and space) (4%).

[X] B. a collection for order information (minimal fields: name, phone number, lesson IDs, and number of space) (4%). 

    Suggestion: the element lessonIDs can contain 1 or more lesson IDs, depending on how many different kinds of lessons you have in your order. Other solutions could be accepted: in fact, how you design this is not the primary aspect of this module, therefore it is up to you to find a reasonable solution that works satisfactorily.
